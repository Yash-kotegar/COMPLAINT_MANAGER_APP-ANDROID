# COMPLAINT_MANAGER_APP-ANDROID
The project has been implemented in modules so as to make it user friendly i.e. if a 
code viewer is finding trouble with a particular function it can go to a particular module and 
make corresponding changes in it instead of searching in the program. Also it is more 
advantageous for future modifications as when modifications are to be made instead of 
searching the whole program module search can be useful as it decreases the time 
consumption.
